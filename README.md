# Assignment

Model the height of the liquid in three interconnected tanks according to specific specifications. For a given tank system, compile a mathematical description of the model in the form of differential equations. Model the hydraulic system in Simulink.
The inflow into the water tanks is given either by a constant value, and one value of the inflow is given by a range that the student correctly chooses so that the levels in all three water tanks in the steady state stabilize within the range of 30-70% of the heights of the individual tanks.
